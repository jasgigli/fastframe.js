# Introduction

## What is FastFrame.js?

FastFrame.js is a next-generation frontend framework designed to provide an optimal developer experience while delivering exceptional performance for users. It combines the best ideas from existing frameworks with innovative approaches to reactivity, performance, and developer experience.

## Key Features

### Compile-time Reactivity

FastFrame.js transforms your reactive code at build time, eliminating the need for a virtual DOM and resulting in highly optimized updates. This approach provides several benefits:

- **Smaller runtime**: Less JavaScript to download, parse, and execute
- **Faster updates**: Direct DOM manipulation without virtual DOM diffing
- **Better performance**: Optimized code paths for reactive updates

### Zero-config Setup

Get started quickly with sensible defaults. FastFrame.js works out of the box with minimal configuration:

- **Simple CLI**: Create new projects with a single command
- **Sensible defaults**: Best practices built-in
- **Extensible**: Add only what you need when you need it

### Partial Hydration

Load only the JavaScript needed for each component, reducing initial load times and improving performance:

- **Component-level hydration**: Each component can be hydrated independently
- **Progressive enhancement**: Start with static HTML and add interactivity as needed
- **Optimized bundles**: Ship less JavaScript to your users

### First-class TypeScript Support

Built from the ground up with TypeScript, providing excellent type safety and developer experience:

- **Type-safe APIs**: All APIs are fully typed
- **Excellent IDE support**: Get autocompletion and type checking
- **Type inference**: Let TypeScript infer types when possible

## Philosophy

FastFrame.js is built on the following principles:

1. **Developer experience matters**: Tools should be intuitive and help developers be productive
2. **Performance is a feature**: Fast load times and responsive UIs are essential
3. **Progressive enhancement**: Start with the basics and add complexity only when needed
4. **Type safety**: Catch errors at compile time, not runtime
5. **Simplicity**: Simple solutions to complex problems

## Comparison with Other Frameworks

While FastFrame.js draws inspiration from many existing frameworks, it takes a unique approach to several key areas:

| Feature | FastFrame.js | React | Vue | Svelte |
|---------|-------------|-------|-----|--------|
| Reactivity | Compile-time | Runtime (hooks) | Runtime (Proxy) | Compile-time |
| Rendering | Direct DOM | Virtual DOM | Virtual DOM | Direct DOM |
| Hydration | Partial | Full | Partial (with Nuxt) | Full |
| TypeScript | First-class | Add-on | Add-on | Add-on |
| Bundle Size | Very small | Medium | Small | Very small |

## When to Use FastFrame.js

FastFrame.js is ideal for:

- Applications where performance is critical
- Projects that benefit from TypeScript
- Teams that value developer experience
- Sites that need progressive enhancement
- Applications of any size, from small to large
